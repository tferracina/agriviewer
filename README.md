## The intersection of computer vision and LLM's. A chatbot designed to convey information on fields using semantic segmentation on satelite imagery. 

We use a Llamaindex powered LLM with specific a specific domain of knowledge, here crop health and humidity, which calls a function which performs semantic segmentation and analysis on satelite imagery. The user has the power to ask where and when the imagery should be taken, such as field A23 near Austin, Texas.
