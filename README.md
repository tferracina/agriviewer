# Agriviewer 

## Chatbot designed to convey information on fields using semantic segmentation on satelite imagery. 

We use a Llamaindex powered LLM with specific a specific domain of knowledge, here crop health and humidity, which calls a function which performs semantic segmentation and analysis on satelite imagery. The user has the power to ask where and when the imagery should be taken.
